# MVP vs Future (Foundations)

## MVP includes
Customer:
- Auth
- Wallet (memberships list)
- My QR
- Membership details (progress + history)

Business:
- Scanner (add stamp / redeem)
- Program basics (rewardName, maxStamps, icon)

Admin/Support:
- Not in MVP UI (only scaffold folders + docs)

## Future (not MVP, but foundations must support)
- Staff management (add/remove staff, roles, plan limits)
- Multiple programs per business
- Campaigns & messages (birthday, winback, promos)
- Marketplace / discovery of businesses
- Enterprise integrations: API clients/keys + externalId mapping

## Foundations we build now (no UI yet)
- Data model supports multi-staff, multi-program, memberships, event log
- External IDs strategy for API integrations
